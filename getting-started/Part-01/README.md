This is part of a [series of articles](https://github.com/PLCnext/SampleRuntime) that demonstrate how to create a runtime application for PLCnext Control. Each article builds on tasks that were completed in earlier articles, so it is recommended to follow the series in sequence.

## Part 1 (optional) - Hello PLCnext

The application developed in this series will start with a PLCnext CLI template for runtime-type projects. In this first step, you will create and use a simpler template to create a "Hello World" console application, and run it on a PLCnext Control device.

While this step is recommended, it is not required for the next step, so you can skip it if you want.

Procedure:

1. Work through the procedure in the following Makers Blog post on the PLCnext Community website:

   [PLCnext CLI Templates](https://www.plcnext-community.net/makersblog/plcnext-cli-templates/)

That's it. :)

You are now familiar with the process of adding a project template to the PLCnext CLI, and building and deploying a simple executable project using that template. The next step does something similar, but using a template for a "runtime"-type application.
